Kratu
=====
> Kratu is an Open Source client-side analysis framework to create simple yet powerful renditions of data. It allows you to dynamically adjust your view of the data to highlight opportunities, issues and correlations in the data.
> [Kratu is a Sanskrit](http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=kratu&script=&direction=SE&link=yes) word and means enlightenment, understanding and intelligence.

You can use Kratu to analyze data for support queue prioritization, account quality optimization, performance analysis, product comparison and much more.
