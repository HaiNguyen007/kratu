It allows you to dynamically adjust your view of the data to highlight opportunities, issues and correlations in the data.\r\n> [Kratu is a Sanskrit](http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=kratu&script=&direction=SE&link=yes) word and means enlightenment, understanding and intelligence.\r\n\r\nYou can use Kratu to analyze data for support queue prioritization, account quality optimization, performance analysis, product comparison and much more.\r\n\r\n* **[Watch the 2 minute video for a quick tour on what it can do](http://youtu.be/xyz123)**\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n**Note: if running locally, you might have to start your browser with a flag to allow local file loading.
