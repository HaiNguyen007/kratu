It allows you to dynamically adjust your view of the data to highlight issues, opportunities and correlations in the data.\r\n\r\n> [Kratu is a Sanskrit word](http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=kratu&script=&direction=SE&link=yes) and means enlightenment, understanding and intelligence.\r\n\r\nIt can compare similar objects by calculating individual scores for all the features we care about.\r\nEach feature is highlighted according to their score, rendering a prioritized heatmap where the objects of most significance float to the top.\r\n\r\n**Have a look at our [tutorial](http://google.github.com/kratu/tutorial/) and dive straight into the deep end, or read on for a more gentle introduction.**\r\n\r\nYou can use Kratu to analyze data for support queue prioritization, account quality optimization, performance analysis, product comparison and much more.\r\n![Example Kratu Report](http://google.github.com/kratu/img/tut_finalreport.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nSimply [download Kratu](https://github.com/google/kratu/archive/master.zip) and extract, or check out the repository:\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/google/kratu.git\r\n```\r\n*Note: If you're running Kratu locally, you might have to start your browser with a flag to allow local file loading.*\r\n*If you're using Chrome, use --allow-file-access-from-files*\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\nIf you want to see more of what Kratu can do, have a look at the [examples included](https://github.com/google/kratu/tree/master/examples).\r\n\r\nOtherwise, here's a quick look at how to render a simple report\r\n```javascript\r\n// Instantiate a new Kratu object\r\nvar kratu = new Kratu();\r\n\r\n// Set the data we'd like to render\r\nkratu.setEntities(data);\r\n\r\n// Tell Kratu where to render our report\r\nkratu.setRenderElement( document.getElementById('kratuReport') );\r\n\r\n// And render it!\r\nkratu.renderReport();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## In-depth tutorial\r\nTo get a better understanding of what Kratu has to offer, go through [this in-depth tutorial](http://google.github.com/kratu/tutorial/), where we'll build a [product comparison analysis](https://github.com/google/kratu/tree/master/examples/spaceshipselector) that can help users figure out which spaceship to buy.\r\n\r\n## Fine print\r\nPull requests are very much appreciated.
